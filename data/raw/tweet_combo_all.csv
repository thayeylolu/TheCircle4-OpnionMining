239,2022-05-13 11:05:01+00:00,clamydomona,I was a huge fan of stuff ten years ago and don't remember specifics anymore and they really wanted to know specifics in the Spice Girls quiz 🙄. They are really keeping up the paranoia this season and weakening any possible alliances. #TheCircle #TheCircleNetflix
240,2022-05-13 10:58:24+00:00,clamydomona,Those are really very specific questions about the Spice Girls. Who knows that stuff? Most realistic would be Nathan's answer because they literally played that song so he'd at least know that's one of theirs and was on his mind. #TheCircle

#TheCircle"
244,2022-05-13 10:20:32+00:00,_Nelleaux,"Crissa might not be buying into “Momma Carol’s” story, and that’s good because that shows she’s intuitive. That would help her get ahead in the game if she’s got a great personality to match. As for “Paul” only setting up a chat with the boys AFTER the ratings… 😑

249,2022-05-13 09:57:14+00:00,_Nelleaux,"So far, John has the best strategy from surface-value although I worry that should a time arise for girl time and sage advice is required, he might be exposed. I like Parker’s strategy too, though I’m not a fan of her first impression. Let’s see how it works out. 💪🏽😤

1237,2022-05-12 01:52:26+00:00,CalebHunton,The host of #TheCircle definitely has upped her snarky one liner game this season.

1245,2022-05-12 01:51:34+00:00,CalebHunton,#TheCircle definitely does a lot of cliff hangers but they’re all so good!
1246,2022-05-12 01:51:24+00:00,CalebHunton,#TheCircle would be 10X harder if they couldn’t take notes.
1247,2022-05-12 01:50:35+00:00,CalebHunton,Bru is such fun casting for the show! They should definitely get more famous social media people! #TheCircle

1250,2022-05-12 01:50:11+00:00,JaimeeRindy,Seems like @CircleNetflix listened to some feedback from last season and didn’t shuffle as many players through this season. I like that because I didn’t think it was fair that the super late comers got to play for the same prize as the OGs #TheCircle

The Circle is all about unexpected twists and having someone who was the person someone else was catfishing as come on to the show and themself and see how the other players react. It would’ve been so cool.

But this is cool too. We still get to see the reactions-"

Depending on how these next few episodes play out, I wouldn’t mind Eversen surviving to the end too.

Imani (Trevor) is an interesting addition. I would’ve been more interested if he had come in as himself since everyone is already familiar with him."

I’m really hoping he picks Alyssa, honestly. Carol (John) really isn’t that bad, but I never cared for him.

The only players I want to reach the end are Bru, Alyssa, Yu Ling, and Frank. I like Eversen so far, so I’d like to see him stay on for a bit too."

1807,2022-05-11 18:47:59+00:00,FellatioAlger,Alex is a dumbass for trying to burn bridges with Rachel. Newbies should always have an alliance coming into the game because statistically they have the lowest chances of winning. #thecircle
1808,2022-05-11 18:47:14+00:00,ChatterboxKeirn,Yu Ling being asked to block someone face to face is obviously because it’s either Crissa or Frank. Since when is the 2nd blocking done face to face? I see the mess is back from production. #TheCircle #TheCircleSeason4 #TheCircleNetflix
1809,2022-05-11 18:47:14+00:00,ChatterboxKeirn,People being ranked last this late in the game is usually for strategic reasons and not because people aren’t vibing with them. Get it together Yu Ling. #TheCircle #TheCircleSeason4 #TheCircleNetflix

Alyssa: Stay (not win tho), Frank: should win, Yu Ling: make it to the final/win, Bru: sweet guy but he’s not  strategic at all, he needs to go, Carol: NEEDS TO GO, Nathan: Respect his game fr but the catfish needs to go, Rachel: should stay"

9379,2022-05-13 15:39:01+00:00,Those_Vibes,"(1) Honestly I genuinely think Alyssa just didn’t like Crissa and that’s why she blocked her. It would have been WAY more logical to block Carol someone Alyssa AND Yu Ling suspected of being a catfish and lying, who is considered really strategic and is rated high #TheCircle"

10462,2022-05-12 01:50:11+00:00,JaimeeRindy,Seems like @CircleNetflix listened to some feedback from last season and didn’t shuffle as many players through this season. I like that because I didn’t think it was fair that the super late comers got to play for the same prize as the OGs #TheCircle

The Circle is all about unexpected twists and having someone who was the person someone else was catfishing as come on to the show and themself and see how the other players react. It would’ve been so cool.

But this is cool too. We still get to see the reactions-"
10746,2022-05-11 22:09:12+00:00,Rejtei,"// #TheCircle 

Depending on how these next few episodes play out, I wouldn’t mind Eversen surviving to the end too.

Imani (Trevor) is an interesting addition. I would’ve been more interested if he had come in as himself since everyone is already familiar with him."
10747,2022-05-11 22:09:12+00:00,Rejtei,"// #TheCircle 

I’m really hoping he picks Alyssa, honestly. Carol (John) really isn’t that bad, but I never cared for him.

The only players I want to reach the end are Bru, Alyssa, Yu Ling, and Frank. I like Eversen so far, so I’d like to see him stay on for a bit too."

11020,2022-05-11 18:47:14+00:00,ChatterboxKeirn,Yu Ling being asked to block someone face to face is obviously because it’s either Crissa or Frank. Since when is the 2nd blocking done face to face? I see the mess is back from production. #TheCircle #TheCircleSeason4 #TheCircleNetflix

If they recognise each other as playing a catfish why not have each other's back rather than get rid of each other? Like Carol and Paul could have.

15841,2022-05-12 01:52:26+00:00,CalebHunton,The host of #TheCircle definitely has upped her snarky one liner game this season.

15849,2022-05-12 01:51:34+00:00,CalebHunton,#TheCircle definitely does a lot of cliff hangers but they’re all so good!
15850,2022-05-12 01:51:24+00:00,CalebHunton,#TheCircle would be 10X harder if they couldn’t take notes.
15851,2022-05-12 01:50:35+00:00,CalebHunton,Bru is such fun casting for the show! They should definitely get more famous social media people! #TheCircle

15854,2022-05-12 01:50:11+00:00,JaimeeRindy,Seems like @CircleNetflix listened to some feedback from last season and didn’t shuffle as many players through this season. I like that because I didn’t think it was fair that the super late comers got to play for the same prize as the OGs #TheCircle

The Circle is all about unexpected twists and having someone who was the person someone else was catfishing as come on to the show and themself and see how the other players react. It would’ve been so cool.

But this is cool too. We still get to see the reactions-"
16138,2022-05-11 22:09:12+00:00,Rejtei,"// #TheCircle 

Depending on how these next few episodes play out, I wouldn’t mind Eversen surviving to the end too.

Imani (Trevor) is an interesting addition. I would’ve been more interested if he had come in as himself since everyone is already familiar with him."
16139,2022-05-11 22:09:12+00:00,Rejtei,"// #TheCircle 

I’m really hoping he picks Alyssa, honestly. Carol (John) really isn’t that bad, but I never cared for him.

The only players I want to reach the end are Bru, Alyssa, Yu Ling, and Frank. I like Eversen so far, so I’d like to see him stay on for a bit too."

16412,2022-05-11 18:47:14+00:00,ChatterboxKeirn,Yu Ling being asked to block someone face to face is obviously because it’s either Crissa or Frank. Since when is the 2nd blocking done face to face? I see the mess is back from production. #TheCircle #TheCircleSeason4 #TheCircleNetflix
