The Circle is all about unexpected twists and having someone who was the person someone else was catfishing as come on to the show and themself and see how the other players react. It would‚Äôve been so cool.

The Circle is all about unexpected twists and having someone who was the person someone else was catfishing as come on to the show and themself and see how the other players react. It would‚Äôve been so cool.

But this is cool too. We still get to see the reactions-"

Depending on how these next few episodes play out, I wouldn‚Äôt mind Eversen surviving to the end too.

Imani (Trevor) is an interesting addition. I would‚Äôve been more interested if he had come in as himself since everyone is already familiar with him."

I‚Äôm really hoping he picks Alyssa, honestly. Carol (John) really isn‚Äôt that bad, but I never cared for him.

The only players I want to reach the end are Bru, Alyssa, Yu Ling, and Frank. I like Eversen so far, so I‚Äôd like to see him stay on for a bit too."

15854,2022-05-12 01:50:11+00:00,JaimeeRindy,Seems like @CircleNetflix listened to some feedback from last season and didn‚Äôt shuffle as many players through this season. I like that because I didn‚Äôt think it was fair that the super late comers got to play for the same prize as the OGs #TheCircle
